# Analyzing Food Data

During this project, I analyze an open source food dataset available here :

[Open Food Dataset](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)

I perform univariate, bivariate, multivariate as well as correlation analysis
of the provided variables in order to draw conclusions about global
health trends.
